[Verse 1]
Fellow armsmen, I ask you
Will you follow me tonight to break their spine
And reclaim what once was mine?
Those cravens backstabbed me, deceived me
Never shall I tolerate their crimes again
Now let the hunt begin, oh
7000 souls, scared and daunted, such a tale of woe
Not too long ago, this village was a golden scene of hope

[Chorus]
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace
Restore our gloria
To livе forever
Bring down the dark rеgime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the Lightbringer!
